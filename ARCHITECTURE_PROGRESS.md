## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Repository Pattern with Tenant Isolation
```typescript
// Single source of tenant filtering
const requirements = await this.tenantScopedRepo.findAll(tenantId);
```

### 2. Value Objects
```typescript
// Immutable, self-validating
const rqs = new RQSScore(85, 90, 80, 75, 85);
const capacity = new SprintCapacity(40);
```

### 3. Aggregate Roots with Domain Logic
```typescript
// Business logic encapsulated
const sprint = Sprint.create({ name, capacity, ... });
sprint.addItem(item); // Enforces invariants
sprint.start(); // Publishes event
```

### 4. Domain Events
```typescript
// All state changes published as events
const event = new SprintCreated(sprintId, tenantId, name, capacity);
await eventPublisher.publishAll([event]);
```

### 5. Anti-Corruption Layers
```typescript
// Shield domain models from external contexts
const itemDTO = await requirementsAdapter.mapToSprintItem(reqId);
```

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Event publishing failures | MEDIUM | Async handlers with retry logic |
| Circular dependencies | MEDIUM | Explicit boundaries + adapters |
| Large aggregates | LOW | Keep small, use child entities |
| Event versioning | MEDIUM | Version events, migration handlers |
| Breaking changes | HIGH | Backward compatible migrations |
